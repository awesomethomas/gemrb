===== Console =====
The 'cheat console'.

**Description:** You can pop the Console window anytime by pressing ctrl-space. Any command you type in will be executed as a GUIScript command. You can use Python variables, issue Python commands as well as the GemRB scripting commands. If a command didn't execute, GemRB will retry its execution by adding "GemRB." to it, thus you can omit it in case you are extremely lazy. Extra shortcuts are defined in the include.py file.

**Examples** (typed in the console):

  * GemRB.Quit()       - quit the program
  * Quit()             - same as above, but shorter
  * EnableCheatKeys(0) - disables the debug keys
