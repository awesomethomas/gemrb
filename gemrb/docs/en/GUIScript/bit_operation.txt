===== Operators =====

The following bitwise operators exist in many guiscript commands:
  * OP_SET  0  - sets exact value
  * OP_AND  1  - performs the AND operation (turns off unlisted bits)
  * OP_OR   2  - performs the OR operation (turns on listed bits)
  * OP_XOR  3  - performs the XOR operation (toggles the listed bits)
  * OP_NAND 4  - performs the NAND operation (turns off listed bits)
